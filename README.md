# C-Roots_Of_A_Quadratic_Equation

This is just a simple program which can solve any polynomail equation upto a max of Degree 2.
Thus Linear and Quadratic Equations.

1) The data is filled in as just values for a,b,c in ax*2 + bx + c
2) The algorith determines degree and solves accordingly
3) For quadratic equations it handles complex number too implicitly
